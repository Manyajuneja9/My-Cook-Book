                      Here’s a step-by-step guide to making Matar Paneer:

                      Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients
                      Chop and Puree: Finely chop the onions and prepare a puree of the tomatoes.
                      Cube the Paneer: Cut the paneer into bite-sized cubes.
                      Step 2: Cook the Base
                      Heat Oil: In a pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil or ghee over medium heat.
                      Add Cumin Seeds: Once the oil is hot, add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds. Let them sizzle for
                      a few seconds.
                      Sauté Onions: Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
                      Step 3: Add Spices and Tomato Puree
                      Ginger-Garlic Paste: Stir in 1 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another
                      minute until the raw smell disappears.
                      Green Chilies: Add the slit or chopped green chilies and sauté for a minute.
                      Add Tomato Puree: Pour in the tomato puree and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring
                      occasionally, until the oil begins to separate from the mixture.
                      Step 4: Add Spices
                      Turmeric and Red Chili Powder: Add 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder and 1 teaspoon of red
                      chili powder. Mix well.
                      Add Green Peas: Stir in 1 cup of green peas (if using frozen, no need to thaw) and cook
                      for 2-3 minutes.
                      Step 5: Add Paneer
                      Paneer Cubes: Gently add the paneer cubes to the pan. Stir carefully to coat them with
                      the masala.
                      Garam Masala and Salt: Add 1 teaspoon of garam masala and salt to taste. Mix gently.
                      Step 6: Simmer
                      Water: If the mixture looks too thick, add a little water (about 1/2 cup) to adjust the
                      consistency.
                      Simmer: Cover the pan and let it simmer for about 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to
                      meld together.
                      Step 7: Finishing Touches
                      Cream or Milk (Optional): If you want a richer gravy, add 1/2 cup of cream or milk at
                      this stage. Stir well.
                      Kasuri Methi (Optional): Crush 1 teaspoon of kasuri methi between your palms and
                      sprinkle it over the curry for added flavor.
                      Step 8: Serve
                      Garnish: Turn off the heat and garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
                      Serving: Serve hot with roti, naan, or rice.
                      Enjoy your delicious homemade Matar Paneer!

                      Here’s a step-by-step procedure to make Kadi Pakora:

                      Step 1: Prepare the Pakoras (Fritters)
                      Mix Ingredients:
                      
                      In a bowl, combine 1 cup gram flour (besan), thinly sliced onion, chopped green chilies, cumin seeds, ajwain (if using), red chili powder, and salt.
                      Make the Batter:
                      
                      Gradually add water to the mixture and stir until you get a thick batter that can hold the ingredients together. It shouldn’t be too runny.
                      Heat Oil:
                      
                      Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.
                      Fry Pakoras:
                      
                      Once the oil is hot, drop spoonfuls of the batter into the oil. Fry in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.
                      Fry until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Set aside.
                      Step 2: Prepare the Kadi (Yogurt Sauce)
                      Mix Yogurt and Besan:
                      
                      In a bowl, whisk together 1 cup yogurt and 2 tablespoons gram flour (besan) until smooth.
                      Add Spices:
                      
                      Stir in turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well.
                      Add Water:
                      
                      Gradually add 2-3 cups of water, stirring continuously to prevent lumps. Adjust the consistency to your liking.
                      Cook the Mixture:
                      
                      Pour the yogurt mixture into a saucepan and cook on medium heat. Stir constantly until it starts to boil. Reduce heat and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
                      Step 3: Temper the Kadi
                      Heat Oil:
                      
                      In a small pan, heat 2-3 tablespoons of oil. Add cumin seeds and mustard seeds.
                      Add Aromatics:
                      
                      Once the seeds crackle, add slit green chilies, dried red chilies, and grated ginger. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.
                      Combine with Kadi:
                      
                      Pour this tempering into the simmering yogurt mixture. Stir well.
                      Step 4: Combine Pakoras and Kadi
                      Add Pakoras:
                      Gently add the fried pakoras to the kadi. Simmer for another 5-7 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
                      Step 5: Serve
                      Garnish:
                      
                      Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
                      Enjoy:
                      
                      Serve hot with steamed rice or roti.
                      Enjoy your delicious Kadi Pakora!

                      Here’s a step-by-step procedure to make Dal Makhni:

                      Step 1: Prepare the Lentils
                      Soak the Lentils:
                      Soak 1 cup of black lentils (urad dal) and 1/4 cup of red kidney beans (rajma) in plenty
                      of water overnight.
                      Step 2: Cook the Lentils
                      Drain and Rinse:

                      After soaking, drain and rinse the lentils and kidney beans.
                      Pressure Cook:

                      In a pressure cooker, add the soaked lentils and kidney beans along with 4-5 cups of
                      water.
                      Add salt to taste and a pinch of turmeric powder.
                      Cook for about 15-20 minutes or until they are soft.
                      Step 3: Prepare the Base
                      Sauté Onions:

                      In a large pot or heavy-bottomed pan, heat 2-3 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.
                      Add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and let them splutter.
                      Add 1 medium onion (finely chopped) and sauté until golden brown.
                      Add Ginger, Garlic, and Green Chilies:

                      Stir in the grated ginger, chopped garlic (4-5 cloves), and slit green chilies (2).
                      Sauté for a couple of minutes until fragrant.
                      Cook Tomatoes:

                      Add 2-3 medium tomatoes (pureed or finely chopped) to the pot.
                      Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the oil starts to separate, about 5-7 minutes.
                      Step 4: Combine Everything
                      Add Cooked Lentils:

                      Add the cooked lentils and kidney beans to the tomato mixture.
                      Stir well to combine.
                      Adjust Consistency:

                      Add water as needed to achieve your desired consistency.
                      Simmer the dal on low heat for at least 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally. This
                      enhances the flavors.
                      Step 5: Add Spices and Cream
                      Season:

                      Add 1 teaspoon of red chili powder and 1 teaspoon of garam masala.
                      Adjust salt if needed.

                      Here’s a step-by-step guide to making Idlis:

                      Step 1: Soak the Ingredients
                      Soak Urad Dal: In a bowl, soak 1 cup of urad dal (split black gram) and 1 teaspoon of
                      fenugreek seeds (if using) in enough water for at least 6 hours or overnight.
                      Soak Rice: In another bowl, soak 2 cups of idli rice in water for the same duration.
                      Step 2: Grind the Batter
                      Drain and Rinse: After soaking, drain the urad dal and rice. Rinse them under running
                      water.
                      Grind Urad Dal: In a wet grinder or blender, grind the urad dal and fenugreek seeds
                      first. Add a little water as needed to make a smooth batter. Scrape down the sides
                      frequently.
                      Grind Rice: Next, grind the soaked rice until it is slightly coarse but well-blended.
                      Combine it with the urad dal batter in a large mixing bowl.
                      Mix the Batters: Stir both batters together until well combined. The consistency should
                      be thick but pourable.
                      Step 3: Ferment the Batter
                      Add Salt: Add salt to taste and mix well.
                      Ferment: Cover the bowl with a lid or cloth and place it in a warm area for 8-12 hours,
                      or until the batter has doubled in size and is bubbly. The time needed for fermentation
                      may vary based on the climate.
                      Step 4: Prepare the Idli Steamer
                      Grease Idli Molds: Lightly grease the idli molds with oil to prevent sticking.
                      Boil Water: In an idli steamer or a large pot, bring water to a boil.
                      Step 5: Steam the Idlis
                      Fill Molds: Pour the fermented batter into the greased idli molds, filling them about
                      3/4 full.
                      Steam: Carefully place the filled molds in the steamer. Cover and steam for about 10-15
                      minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the idlis comes out clean.
                      Remove Molds: Once done, remove the molds from the steamer and let them cool for a
                      minute.
                      Step 6: Serve
                      Demold Idlis: Gently remove the idlis from the molds using a spoon or knife.
                      Serve Hot: Serve hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or any chutney of your choice.
                      Enjoy your delicious, fluffy Idlis!

                      Here’s a step-by-step guide to making Sambar:

                      Step 1: Cook the Dal
                      Rinse the Dal: Rinse 1 cup of toor dal (pigeon peas) under running water until the water
                      runs clear.
                      Cook the Dal: In a pressure cooker or pot, add the rinsed dal with 3 cups of water.
                      Pressure cook for about 3-4 whistles or cook until soft in a pot, which may take around
                      30-40 minutes. Mash the dal lightly once cooked.
                      Step 2: Prepare the Vegetables
                      Chop Vegetables: Chop your choice of mixed vegetables (carrots, potatoes, beans,
                      drumsticks, eggplant) into bite-sized pieces.
                      Cook Vegetables: In a separate pot, add the chopped vegetables, 1 chopped onion, 1
                      chopped tomato, 2-3 slit green chilies, and salt to taste. Add enough water to cover the
                      vegetables and cook until they are tender.
                      Step 3: Add Tamarind
                      Prepare Tamarind: If using tamarind paste, mix 1 teaspoon of it with 1/4 cup of warm
                      water. If using soaked tamarind, squeeze out the pulp and strain the liquid.
                      Add to Vegetables: Once the vegetables are cooked, add the tamarind extract to the pot.
                      Step 4: Add Cooked Dal and Sambar Powder
                      Combine Dal and Vegetables: Add the cooked and mashed dal to the vegetable mixture.
                      Add Sambar Powder: Stir in 2 tablespoons of sambar powder and mix well. Adjust the
                      consistency with water if it's too thick. Simmer for about 10 minutes to allow the
                      flavors to meld.
                      Step 5: Temper the Sambar
                      Heat Oil: In a small pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil or ghee.
                      Add Spices: Once hot, add 1 teaspoon of mustard seeds and let them splutter. Then add 1
                      teaspoon of cumin seeds, 1-2 dried red chilies, and a pinch of asafoetida (hing).
                      Pour Tempering into Sambar: Pour the tempering over the simmering sambar and mix well.
                      Step 6: Garnish and Serve
                      Garnish: Turn off the heat and garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
                      Serve Hot: Serve hot with idli, dosa, rice, or even as a soup.
                      Enjoy your flavorful Sambar!

                      Here’s a step-by-step guide to making Medhu Vada:

                      Step 1: Soak the Dal
                      Rinse Urad Dal: Rinse 1 cup of urad dal (split black gram) under running water until the
                      water runs clear.
                      Soak Dal: Soak the rinsed urad dal in enough water for about 4-6 hours or overnight.
                      Step 2: Prepare the Batter
                      Drain and Rinse: After soaking, drain the urad dal and rinse it again.
                      Grind the Dal: In a wet grinder or a food processor, grind the soaked urad dal with a
                      little water (about 1/4 cup or as needed) to form a smooth, thick batter. Scrape down
                      the sides as needed.
                      Mix Ingredients: Transfer the batter to a mixing bowl. Add chopped green chilies, grated
                      ginger, chopped coriander leaves, chopped onions (if using), cumin seeds, asafoetida (if
                      using), and salt to taste. Mix well.
                      Step 3: Heat the Oil
                      Prepare for Frying: In a deep frying pan or kadhai, heat oil over medium heat. To check
                      if the oil is ready, drop a small amount of batter into the oil; if it sizzles and rises
                      to the surface, the oil is ready.
                      Step 4: Shape the Vadas
                      Wet Your Hands: Keep a bowl of water nearby. Wet your hands to prevent the batter from
                      sticking.
                      Shape the Vadas: Take a small portion of the batter (about a lemon-sized ball), flatten
                      it in your palm, and make a hole in the center to form a doughnut shape. Alternatively,
                      you can use your fingers to shape it.
                      Repeat: Repeat the process with the remaining batter.
                      Step 5: Fry the Vadas
                      Fry Vadas: Carefully slide the shaped vadas into the hot oil. Fry them in batches,
                      making sure not to overcrowd the pan.
                      Cook Until Golden: Fry until they turn golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 4-5
                      minutes. Use a slotted spoon to turn them occasionally for even cooking.
                      Drain Excess Oil: Once cooked, remove the vadas from the oil and drain them on paper
                      towels to remove excess oil.
                      Step 6: Serve
                      Serve Hot: Serve Medhu Vadas hot with coconut chutney, sambar, or any dip of your
                      choice.
                      Enjoy your crispy and delicious Medhu Vadas!

                      Here’s a step-by-step guide to making Veg Pulao:

                      Step 1: Prepare the Rice
                      Rinse the Rice: Rinse 1 cup of basmati rice under running water until the water runs
                      clear. This helps remove excess starch.
                      Soak the Rice: Soak the rinsed rice in water for about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.
                      Step 2: Cook the Vegetables
                      Chop Vegetables: Chop your choice of mixed vegetables (like carrots, peas, green beans,
                      and potatoes) into small pieces.
                      Heat Oil/Ghee: In a large pot or pressure cooker, heat 2 tablespoons of oil or ghee over
                      medium heat.
                      Step 3: Sauté Spices and Onions
                      Add Whole Spices: Once the oil is hot, add 1-2 bay leaves, 2-3 cloves, 2-3 green
                      cardamom pods, 1 small stick of cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds. Sauté for a few
                      seconds until fragrant.
                      Sauté Onions: Add 1 sliced medium onion and sauté until it turns golden brown.
                      Step 4: Add Vegetables and Spices
                      Add Ginger-Garlic Paste: Stir in 1 teaspoon of ginger-garlic paste and sauté for about a
                      minute until the raw smell disappears.
                      Add Vegetables: Add the chopped mixed vegetables and 1-2 slit green chilies. Sauté for
                      about 2-3 minutes.
                      Season: Add salt to taste and mix well.
                      Step 5: Add Rice and Water
                      Add Soaked Rice: Gently add the drained basmati rice to the pot and sauté for 2-3
                      minutes, making sure the rice is well coated with oil.
                      Add Water: Pour in 2-3 cups of water (the ratio is typically 1 cup rice to 2 cups water,
                      but adjust as needed). You can also add 1-2 tablespoons of lemon juice for flavor.
                      Bring to a Boil: Stir everything gently, bring it to a boil, and then reduce the heat to
                      low.
                      Step 6: Cook the Pulao
                      Cover and Cook: Cover the pot with a lid and let it simmer on low heat for about 15-20
                      minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed. If using a pressure
                      cooker, you can cook without the weight for about 10 minutes.
                      Fluff the Rice: Once cooked, turn off the heat and let it sit for about 5 minutes. Then,
                      fluff the rice gently with a fork.
                      Step 7: Serve
                      Garnish: Garnish with fresh coriander leaves if desired.
                      Serve Hot: Serve the Veg Pulao hot with raita, pickle, or a side salad.
                      Enjoy your delicious Veg Pulao!

                  <div class="modal-body">
                      Here’s a step-by-step guide to making Samosas:

                      Step 1: Prepare the Dough
                      Mix Flour and Ingredients: In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1/2
                      teaspoon of salt, and 4 tablespoons of oil or ghee.
                      Knead the Dough: Gradually add water and knead until you form a smooth, firm dough.
                      Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes.
                      Step 2: Prepare the Filling
                      Boil and Mash Potatoes: Boil 2-3 medium potatoes until soft, then peel and mash them in
                      a bowl.
                      Add Vegetables: If using, add 1/2 cup of boiled green peas to the mashed potatoes.
                      Mix Spices: In a pan, heat a little oil and add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and optional
                      mustard seeds. Once they splutter, add 1-2 chopped green chilies and 1 teaspoon of
                      grated ginger. Sauté for a minute.
                      Combine: Add the mashed potatoes, boiled peas, 1 teaspoon of garam masala, 1/2 teaspoon
                      of turmeric powder, 1/2 teaspoon of red chili powder, and salt to taste. Mix well and
                      cook for a few minutes. Remove from heat and let it cool. Garnish with chopped coriander
                      leaves.
                      Step 3: Shape the Samosas
                      Divide the Dough: After resting, knead the dough again and divide it into small balls
                      (about the size of a golf ball).
                      Roll Out: Take one dough ball, flatten it slightly, and roll it out into a thin oval or
                      circle (about 6 inches in diameter).
                      Cut the Dough: Cut the rolled dough in half to create two semicircles.
                      Form Cones: Take one semicircle, and form a cone by folding it over and sealing the edge
                      with a little water. Pinch the bottom to close it.
                      Fill the Cone: Fill the cone with the potato filling, leaving a little space at the top.
                      Seal the open edge with water to ensure it’s completely closed.
                      Repeat: Repeat the process for the remaining dough and filling.
                      Step 4: Fry the Samosas
                      Heat Oil: In a deep frying pan or kadhai, heat oil over medium heat. To test if the oil
                      is hot enough, drop a small piece of dough; if it sizzles and rises to the surface, the
                      oil is ready.
                      Fry Samosas: Carefully slide the filled samosas into the hot oil. Fry in batches, making
                      sure not to overcrowd the pan.
                      Cook Until Golden: Fry until they turn golden brown and crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Use a
                      slotted spoon to turn them occasionally for even cooking.
                      Drain Oil: Once done, remove the samosas from the oil and drain them on paper towels to
                      remove excess oil.
                      Step 5: Serve
                      Serve Hot: Serve the samosas hot with green chutney, tamarind chutney, or yogurt.
                      Enjoy your delicious homemade Samosas!

                      Here’s a step-by-step guide to making simple stir-fried noodles:

                      Step 1: Cook the Noodles
                      Boil Water: In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt for flavor.
                      Cook Noodles: Add 200 grams of noodles (any type: egg, wheat, rice, or instant) to the
                      boiling water. Cook according to the package instructions until al dente.
                      Drain and Rinse: Once cooked, drain the noodles in a colander and rinse them under cold
                      water to stop the cooking process. Set aside.
                      Step 2: Prepare the Vegetables
                      Chop Vegetables: Prepare 1 cup of mixed vegetables (like bell peppers, carrots,
                      broccoli, and beans) by chopping them into bite-sized pieces.
                      Mince Garlic: Finely chop 2-3 cloves of garlic and set aside.
                      Step 3: Stir-Fry the Vegetables
                      Heat Oil: In a large pan or wok, heat 2-3 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat.
                      Add Garlic: Once the oil is hot, add the minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds
                      until fragrant.
                      Add Vegetables: Add the chopped mixed vegetables and stir-fry for about 3-4 minutes
                      until they are tender but still crisp.
                      Step 4: Add Noodles and Sauce
                      Add Noodles: Add the cooked noodles to the pan with the vegetables.
                      Season: Pour in 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of vinegar (optional). If you
                      like it spicy, you can add 1-2 chopped green chilies or 1 teaspoon of chili sauce.
                      Mix Well: Toss everything together gently to combine, ensuring the noodles are coated
                      with the sauce and mixed with the vegetables. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.
                      Step 5: Final Touches
                      Taste and Adjust: Taste the noodles and adjust the seasoning with more soy sauce, salt,
                      or pepper as needed.
                      Garnish: If desired, sprinkle chopped spring onions on top for garnish.
                      Step 6: Serve
                      Serve Hot: Serve the stir-fried noodles hot, either as a main dish or as a side.
                      Enjoy your delicious homemade noodles!

                      Here’s a step-by-step guide to making Honey Chilli Potato:

                      Step 1: Prepare the Potatoes
                      Cut Potatoes: Peel and cut 2 large potatoes into thin fries or wedges.
                      Soak Potatoes: Soak the cut potatoes in water for about 15-20 minutes. This helps remove
                      excess starch and makes them crispier.
                      Step 2: Fry the Potatoes
                      Drain and Dry: After soaking, drain the potatoes and pat them dry with a kitchen towel.
                      Coat with Cornstarch: In a mixing bowl, toss the dried potato pieces with 1/4 cup of
                      cornstarch until evenly coated.
                      Heat Oil: In a deep frying pan or kadhai, heat enough oil for frying over medium heat.
                      Fry Potatoes: Once the oil is hot, carefully add the coated potatoes in batches. Fry
                      until they are golden and crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Remove them using a slotted spoon
                      and drain on paper towels.
                      Step 3: Prepare the Sauce
                      Heat a Pan: In a separate pan, heat 1-2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat.
                      Add Garlic and Ginger: Add 2-3 cloves of minced garlic and 1 tablespoon of grated
                      ginger. Sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
                      Add Green Chilies: Add 1-2 sliced green chilies and stir for another 30 seconds.
                      Step 4: Combine Ingredients
                      Mix Sauce Ingredients: In a bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of honey, 2 tablespoons of soy
                      sauce, 1 tablespoon of chili sauce, and 1 tablespoon of tomato ketchup (if using). Mix
                      well.
                      Add Sauce to Pan: Pour the sauce mixture into the pan with garlic and ginger. Stir well
                      to combine and let it simmer for about 1-2 minutes.
                      Step 5: Toss in the Potatoes
                      Add Fried Potatoes: Add the crispy fried potatoes to the pan. Toss them gently in the
                      sauce until well coated.
                      Cook Briefly: Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes to allow the flavors to meld, stirring
                      gently.
                      Step 6: Serve
                      Garnish: Transfer the Honey Chilli Potato to a serving plate. Garnish with chopped
                      spring onions and sesame seeds if desired.
                      Enjoy: Serve hot as an appetizer or snack!

                      Step 1: Prepare the Manchurian Balls
                      Chop Vegetables: Finely chop 1 cup of mixed vegetables (like cabbage, carrots, bell
                      peppers, and beans).

                      Make the Mixture: In a mixing bowl, combine the chopped vegetables with:

                      1/2 cup all-purpose flour (maida)
                      1/4 cup cornstarch
                      1-2 chopped green chilies
                      1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste
                      Salt and pepper (to taste)
                      Mix Well: Combine everything thoroughly until you have a dough-like consistency. If it’s
                      too dry, add a little water, but avoid making it too wet.

                      Form Balls: Take small portions of the mixture and roll them into small balls (about the
                      size of a marble).
                      Set Aside: Place the shaped balls on a plate.<br><br>
                      Step 3: Fry the Manchurian Balls
                      Heat Oil: In a deep frying pan or kadhai, heat enough oil over medium heat for deep
                      frying.
                      Fry Balls: Once the oil is hot, carefully drop the vegetable balls into the oil in
                      batches. Fry until they are golden brown and crispy, about 4-5 minutes.
                      Drain: Remove the fried balls using a slotted spoon and drain them on paper
                      towels.<br><br>
                      Step 4: Prepare the Sauce
                      Heat Oil in a Pan: In a separate pan, heat 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat.
                      Sauté Aromatics: Add 2-3 minced garlic cloves and 1-inch piece of finely chopped ginger.
                      Sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
                      Add Green Chilies: Add 2-3 slit green chilies and sauté for another 30 seconds.<br><br>
                      Step 5: Add Sauce Ingredients
                      Combine Sauces: Add:
                      1/4 cup soy sauce
                      2 tablespoons tomato ketchup
                      1 tablespoon chili sauce (adjust to taste)
                      1 tablespoon vinegar
                      Stir Well: Mix everything together and let it simmer for about 1-2 minutes.<br><br>
                      Step 6: Thicken the Sauce
                      Add Cornflour Mixture: In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of cornflour with 1/4 cup of
                      water to create a slurry. Gradually add this to the sauce while stirring continuously.
                      Cook Until Thickened: Cook the sauce for another 2-3 minutes until it thickens to your
                      desired consistency.<br><br>
                      Step 7: Combine Manchurian with Sauce
                      Add Fried Balls: Gently add the fried vegetable balls to the sauce and toss to coat them
                      evenly. Cook for another minute to allow the flavors to meld.<br><br>
                      Step 8: Serve<br><br>
                      Garnish: Garnish with chopped spring onions.
                      Enjoy: Serve hot with fried rice, noodles, or as an appetizer!
                      Enjoy your delicious Vegetable Manchurian!
