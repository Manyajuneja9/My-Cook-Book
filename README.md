My cook-book - Where Flavor Meets Community​

We are a group of five university students collaborating on a project titled MY COOK BOOK. The aim of this project is to develop a responsive and user-friendly website for recipe management. My Cook Book is an intuitive and visually engaging recipe sharing platform crafted for culinary enthusiasts of all levels. Whether you're a passionate home cook or an experienced chef, the platform empowers users to discover, share, and manage their favorite recipes with ease. Designed to foster a sense of community, My Cook Book encourages users to connect over a shared love for cooking, while streamlining the way they curate and revisit their culinary creations.

My Cook-book is more than just a recipe-sharing platform — it's a vibrant culinary hub where food lovers from around the world gather to explore, create, and celebrate the joy of cooking. ​

Designed with passion and simplicity, the platform empowers users to share their cherished family recipes, discover hidden gems from other kitchens, and connect over a shared love of food.​

From traditional dishes to modern twists, My Cook-book transforms everyday cooking into an interactive, inspiring, and delicious experience. ​

With personalized cookbooks, step-by-step guides, and community ratings, this platform makes it easy for everyone — from beginner cooks to seasoned chefs — to find their flavor and share it with the world.​

Blending creativity with code, our team functioned like a well-oiled kitchen — each member a vital ingredient in crafting a seamless recipe-sharing experience.
