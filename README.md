# My-Cook-Book
We are a group of five university students collaborating on a project titledÂ MY COOK BOOK. The aim of this project is to develop a responsive and user-friendly website for recipe management. My Cook Book is an intuitive and visually engaging recipe sharing platform crafted for culinary enthusiasts of all levels. Whether you're a passionate home cook or an experienced chef, the platform empowers users to discover, share, and manage their favorite recipes with ease. Designed to foster a sense of community, My Cook Book encourages users to connect over a shared love for cooking, while streamlining the way they curate and revisit their culinary creations.
