        Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to making Aloo Ka Paratha:

        Step 1: Prepare the Dough
        Mix Flour and Salt: In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of whole wheat flour and a pinch of
        salt.
        Add Water: Gradually add water, mixing with your hands, until the dough comes together.
        Knead the Dough: Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until smooth. Optionally, you can
        add a tablespoon of oil for softness.
        Rest the Dough: Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 20-30 minutes.
        Step 2: Prepare the Filling
        Boil and Mash Potatoes: Boil the potatoes until soft, then peel and mash them in a bowl.
        Mix Ingredients: Add cumin seeds, chopped green chilies, grated ginger (if using),
        chopped coriander leaves, salt, garam masala, and red chili powder to the mashed
        potatoes. Mix well.
        Step 3: Roll the Parathas
        Divide the Dough: After resting, divide the dough into small balls (about the size of a
        golf ball).
        Flatten the Dough: Take one dough ball and flatten it slightly with your fingers. Dust
        it with some flour.
        Add Filling: Place a portion of the potato filling in the center of the flattened dough.
        Bring the edges together to enclose the filling.
        Roll Out the Paratha: Gently flatten the stuffed dough ball and roll it out into a
        circle, dusting with flour as needed to prevent sticking. Aim for about 6-7 inches in
        diameter.
        Step 4: Cook the Parathas
        Heat the Pan: Preheat a tawa (flat skillet) or a non-stick pan over medium heat.
        Cook the Paratha: Place the rolled paratha on the hot pan. Cook for about 1-2 minutes
        until bubbles form.
        Flip and Apply Ghee: Flip the paratha and apply ghee or oil on the cooked side. Cook for
        another 1-2 minutes until golden brown. Press lightly with a spatula to ensure even
        cooking.
        Repeat: Repeat the process for the remaining dough and filling.
        Step 5: Serve
        Serve hot Aloo Ka Parathas with yogurt, pickle, or chutney.
        Enjoy your delicious homemade Aloo Ka Paratha!
